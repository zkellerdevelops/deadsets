<h1>NSS Ruby Capstone - DeadSets App</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This is a Unix Command Line app I am building using Ruby for my capstone project for Nashville Software School.
The purpose is to create a way for fans of the band the Grateful Dead to look up concert set lists from the band's long an illustrious career of live performances.</p>


<h2>Project Status / To Do</h2>

<p>TBD once project has been mapped out.</p>



<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>

<p>App is launched from within the UNIX bash terminal via a UNIX system or OS X terminal application.

App will ask the user to enter a date of a desired concert from 1965 - 1995.

If the date entered corresponds with an actual Grateful Dead concert date, the terminal will query the setlist.fm API and print the concert setlist as text into the terminal window.

If the date entered does not correspond with a Grateful Dead concert date, the app will print a message telling the user that there was no concert on the date entered, and to enter another date.

Future functionality might include the ability to email specific set lists to the user by entering in the user's email address?<p>




<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>App must be downloaded and run from the UNIX terminal.</p>
